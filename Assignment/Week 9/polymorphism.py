# Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming, it refers to use of a single type entity to 
# represent different types in different scenarios

name = 'Jim' # str

print(len(name))

some_list = ["some", "name"] # list
print(len(some_list))
# That's polymorphism in action, a single function does know
# how to handle different kinds of objects as  expected
